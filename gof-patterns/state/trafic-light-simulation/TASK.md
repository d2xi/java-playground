Task: Implement a traffic light simulation using the State pattern.

Description:
You are tasked with implementing a traffic light simulation using the State pattern in Java. The traffic light has three states: Red, Yellow, and Green. The traffic light starts with the Red state, then transitions to Yellow, and finally to Green. After Green, it transitions back to Red, and the cycle repeats. The traffic light should display the current state and transition to the next state after a specified time interval.
