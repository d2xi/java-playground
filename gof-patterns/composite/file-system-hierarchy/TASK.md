Task: Implement a File System Hierarchy

Description:
You are tasked with implementing a file system hierarchy that consists of directories and files. Directories can contain both directories and files, while files represent actual files with data. The file system hierarchy should be designed in a way that it can be easily traversed, and operations such as adding, deleting, and displaying files/directories can be performed seamlessly.
